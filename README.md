## Overview

TermRunway helps students plan income and expenses, understand their remaining balance, and estimate a practical daily spending limit for the time remaining in a semester.

The project is intentionally evolving as I learn more about frontend development, application logic, validation, data persistence, and software maintenance.

## Features

- Multiple income sources and expense categories
- Semester and monthly budgeting modes
- Automatic income, expense, balance, and daily-limit calculations
- 50/30/20 budgeting reference
- Persistent browser storage with `localStorage`
- Reset budget functionality
- Printable / PDF-friendly budget summary
- Responsive mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts
- Input validation and edge-case handling
- Student-focused dashboard UI

## Calculation Flow

Income + Planned Expenses
          ↓
    Remaining Balance
          ↓
   Time Remaining
          ↓

```

The application also handles cases such as missing dates, expired semester dates, zero income, expenses exceeding available funds, and invalid numeric input.
